# Wez's Sonos Client API for Rust

This is a rust crate that has been partially generated from the available sonos
device metadata found in @svrooij's
[sonos-api-docs](https://github.com/svrooij/sonos-api-docs) repository.

It provides an interface to discover and issue commands to Sonos devices on
the network, as well as subscribe to events generated by those devices.

Under the covers, this crate makes use of
[instant-xml](https://docs.rs/instant-xml/), a serde-like approach to interact
with XML data in a declarative way.
